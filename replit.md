# AutoSense Diagnostics Web Application

## Project Overview
Professional automotive diagnostic platform built as a web application for garages and technicians. Provides real-time vehicle diagnostics, maintenance insights, and comprehensive reporting tools.

## Features Implemented
- **Professional Header**: Enhanced navigation with search functionality, mobile menu, notifications, and user profile management
- **Hero Section**: Professional branding with automotive imagery and feature highlights
- **Dashboard**: Real-time sensor data visualization, diagnostic history, and statistics
- **Vehicle Profiles**: Comprehensive vehicle information management with health status indicators
- **Diagnostic History**: Tabular view of diagnostic sessions with export capabilities
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Fully implemented theme switching
- **Mobile Responsive**: Optimized for tablets and smartphones used in garage environments

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Express.js server (ready for expansion)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (configured but not yet connected to frontend)
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side navigation
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/ui with Radix UI primitives
- **State Management**: React Query for data fetching

## Design System
Follows automotive industry standards with professional blue color palette, technical precision focus, and high contrast for various lighting conditions. Design guidelines documented in `design_guidelines.md`.

## Current Status
- âœ… Professional frontend prototype completed
- âœ… Enhanced header with navigation and mobile support
- ðŸ”„ Backend API routes ready for implementation
- ðŸ”„ Database schema ready for data persistence

## GitHub Integration Note
**GitHub Integration Dismissed**: User chose not to complete Replit's GitHub integration authorization flow. For future GitHub setup, consider:
1. Manual git repository initialization and remote setup
2. Direct GitHub CLI usage
3. Replit's Git panel for version control
4. Manual code export and repository creation

## User Preferences
- Professional automotive platform focus
- Mobile-first responsive design
- High-quality prototype development
- Clean, modern interface design

## Next Steps
1. Connect frontend to backend APIs
2. Implement real diagnostic data flow
3. Add vehicle registration and management
4. Integrate with OBD-II devices
5. Implement user authentication and role management
